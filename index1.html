Hi! My name is Rasikh Amirali. I am currently a Junior at SMU (Southern Methodist University) studying Electrical Engineering with a focus in Computer Science.
I've taken a couple of basic classes, including Circuit Analysis, Digital Logic Design, Java, and C++. I've had some basic experience with HTML, Swift, and Python as well this summer.
